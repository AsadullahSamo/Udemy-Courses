These commands work on data level
We will be using Students example again

A. INSERT --> Use to insert values in table
Syntax: INSERT INTO Students VALUES(1, 'Asad');
	INSERT INTO Students VALUES(2, 'Moiz');
	INSERT INTO Students VALUES(3, 'Waryal');

1. to insert specific values in specific cols we use
Syntax: INSERT INTO Table_Name (col1, col2, col3) VALUES(Value1, Value2, Value3);

2. Shorthand is 
Syntax: INSERT INTO Table_Name 
	VALUES(firstRow values), (secondRow Values), (thirdRow Values);

3.. To copy data of one table to another we can use insert like
	INSERT INTO Student1 
	SELECT * FROM Students;
4. To copy some cols from table1 to table2
	INSERT INTO Student1 
	SELECT Name FROM Students;

B. UPDATE --> Use to update data in a table
1.  To update Entire column with given value
Syntax: UPDATE TableName SET Column1 = Value1, Column2 = Value2;
e.g.    UPDATE Students set Name = 'Hassan' (Now entire column name will be filled with hassan)

2. To update specific Cols with specific values using WHERE Clause
Syntax:   UPDATE TableName SET Column1 = Value1, Column2 = Value2 WHERE condition;
	e.g. update Students SET Id = 7, Name = 'Hassan' Where Name = 'Asad';
3. Using Expression 
	e.g. update Students SET Id = Id+7 Where Name = 'Asad';

C. DELETE
.Used to delete a table or its some data using WHERE clause(but just data inside table is deleted not table itself, data can be roll backed) 

1. To delete entire table
SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0; --> Also run this before delete
Syntax: DELETE FROM TableName
ROLLBACK; --> To rollback data

2. To delete some data
Syntax:  DELETE FROM TableName WHERE ColName = Value
