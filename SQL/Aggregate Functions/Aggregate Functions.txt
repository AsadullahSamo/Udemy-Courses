. An aggregate function performs a calculation on a set of values, and returns a single 
value, except for COUNT(*). Aggregate functions ignore null values. Aggregate functions 
are often used with the GROUP BY clause of the SELECT statement.
. They work on multiple rows

1.  COUNT(colName)   --> Counts all rows rows from cols

SELECT COUNT(*) AS 'Count all rows' FROM books;      --  Count all rows from books
SELECT COUNT(author_fname) FROM books;               --  Count all author's first names
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT author_fname) FROM books;      --  Count all distinct first names of author

2. GROUP BY   --> "GROUP BY summarizes OR aggregates identical data into single rows"
-- Question: How many books written by each author
SELECT author_lname FROM books GROUP BY author_lname;          -- Group the rows from books table based on author_lname --> All author with same name will be grouped into one row and counted as one row
SELECT author_lname, COUNT(title) FROM books       -- Count all books written by each author, it counts all rows in each group, not all the table(that's what we are saying to this)
GROUP BY author_lname

b. -- GROUP BY with multiple cols
SELECT author_fname, author_lname fROM books GROUP BY author_lname, author_fname;


3. MIN() AND MAX()
-- Question: Find minimum released year
SELECT MIN(released_year) FROM books;
SELECT MAX(pages) FROM books;
SELECT MIN(author_lname), MAX(author_lname) FROM books;      -- it finds min and max based on alphabetical order
