1. !=
2. NOT LIKE
3. >
4. <=, <, >=
5. LOGICAL AND   --> Can have as many chains as we want e.g.
	SELECT title FROM books 
	WHERE author_lname = 'Eggers'
	AND released_year > 2010
	AND title LIKE '%novel%';       (same for OR)
6. LOGICAL OR
7. BETWEEN, NOT BETWEEN 

CAST(expr AS TYPE)   --> e.g. CAST('09:00:10' AS TIME);
e.g. SELECT CAST('09:00:10' AS TIME)
. Better to use CAST() with between and all sort of date and time comparisons

8. IN, NOT IN
9. CASE
	SELECT title, stock_quantity,
	CASE
		WHEN stock_quantity BETWEEN 0 AND 50 THEN '*'
    		WHEN stock_quantity BETWEEN 51 AND 100 THEN '**'
	   	ELSE '***'
    		END AS stock_rating
	FROM books;


10. IS NULL, IS NOT NULL
