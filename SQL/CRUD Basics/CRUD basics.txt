A. Retrieve
1.  SELECT statement
Syntax: SELECT col1, col2 FROM <Table Name>     e.g. SELECT name, age FROM cats;

2.  WHERE Clause
Syntax: SELECT col1, col2 FROM <Table Name> WHERE colname = condition;     e.g. SELECT name, age FROM cats WHERE age = 4;

3.  Aliases (some temp name for col at the time of output)
e.g.: SELECT cat_id AS id, name FROM cats;

B. Update

1. update <Table Name> set col = newValue WHERE col = condition;
e.g. update cats set breed = 'shorthair' WHERE name = 'Tammy';
If we didn't include WHERE Clause every col will be updated with the value given to set
		
		(For multiple updates)

UPDATE cats SET name = 'Blue', breed = 'shorthair' WHERE age > 13;

. A quick rule of thumb is "Always select column before update" --> To see what we're updating or deleting, so as to avoid data losses

C. DELETE
1. DELETE FROM <Table Name> WHERE colName = condition;   e.g. DELETE FROM cats WHERE age = 13;
(Without WHERE the entire table will be deleted)
