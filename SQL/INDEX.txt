2. Always make index of those columns from which you will be retreiving data 
frequently 
3. Index columns which have joins to improve joins performance
4. Always avoid indexing cols that contain too much NULL vals(because its effect searching result)
5. Small tables do not require indexes (use which contains thousands of records)
